# [Professional README Generator](https://github.com/norklas/ragdoll-fluff)

## Description

This is a simple command line node.js application that will generate a formatted **README.md** file based upon user input.

My motivation for this project was to understand node.js more, and learn how to use inquirer. I built this project to make the process of creating a README be more efficient, and quick. I learned how to use the ternary operator more effectively, as well as using inquirer and generating a file from the prompt responses.

## Installation

```node
npm install
```

## Usage
